# Login Credentials

These are the valid credentials for the different roles in the IA Management System.
Note: Currently, the system accepts **any password** that is at least 3 characters long.

| Role | User ID Examples | Password |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Student** | `21CS045`<br>`S123`<br>`DIP/2024/CS/001` | `password` |
| **Faculty** | `FAC001` (Manju Sree)<br>`FAC002` (Ramesh Gouda)<br>`FAC003` (Wahida Banu)<br>`FAC004` (Nasrin Banu)<br>`FAC005` (Sunil Babu)<br>`FAC006` (Shreedar Singh) | `password` |
| **HOD** | `HODCS`<br>`HOD/CS/001` | `password` |
| **Principal** | `PRIN01`<br>`ADMIN`<br>`PRIN/001` | `password` |

> **Note:** These credentials check the ID prefix (S/DIP, F/FAC, H/HOD, P/PRIN/ADMIN) to determine the role. All data shown after login is currently mocked/static but will be connected to the backend soon.
